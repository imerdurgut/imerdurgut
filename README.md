## Hi, I'm Imer ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to transition into a Junior Full-Stack Developer role where I can directly contribute to creating impactful digital experiences. With a background in Industrial Engineering and five years of hands-on experience in product management, I have developed strong analytical skills and a deep appreciation for user-centered design. After completing an intensive 9-week coding bootcamp at Le Wagon, I gained practical experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, while also enhancing my understanding of agile workflows and team collaboration. I'm eager to apply these skills to build innovative and dynamic web applications.
